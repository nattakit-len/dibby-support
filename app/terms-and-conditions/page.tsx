      </p>

      <h2>User Accounts and Authentication</h2>

      <h3>Google Sign-In</h3>

      <p>
        The Application uses Google Sign-In as the primary method for user
        authentication. By using the Application, you agree to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Provide accurate and complete information from your Google account
        </li>
        <li>
          Maintain the security and confidentiality of your Google account
          credentials
        </li>

          Notify the Service Provider immediately of any unauthorized use of
          your account
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>You acknowledge that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Application accesses only basic profile information from your
          Google account (name, email, profile picture, and user ID)
        </li>
        <li>
          You can revoke the Application's access to your Google account at any
          time through your Google Account Settings
        </li>
        <li>
          Revoking access may limit or prevent your ability to use certain
          features of the Application
        </li>
        <li>
          The Service Provider is not responsible for any issues arising from
          your Google account, including account suspension or termination by
          Google
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Account Termination</h3>

      <p>
        The Service Provider reserves the right to suspend or terminate your
        account at any time if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You violate these Terms and Conditions</li>
        <li>You engage in fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activities</li>
        <li>Your account has been inactive for an extended period</li>

          It is necessary to protect the Service Provider's rights or other

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>

      <p>
        The Application stores and processes personal data that you have
        provided to the Service Provider in order to provide the Service. It is
        your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to
        the Application. The Service Provider strongly advises against
        jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves removing software
        restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of
        your device. Such actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses,
        malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features, and may
        result in the Application not functioning correctly or at all.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

      <p>
        Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have
        their own Terms and Conditions. Below are the links to the Terms and
        Conditions of the third-party service providers used by the Application:

      <p>
        By using the Application, you also agree to comply with the terms and
        conditions of these third-party service providers, particularly Google's
        Terms of Service for authentication services.
      </p>

      <h2>Internet Connection Requirements</h2>

      <p>
        Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility
        for certain aspects. Some functions of the Application require an active
        internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile
        network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the
        Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to
        Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are using the Application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be
        aware that your mobile network provider's agreement terms still apply.
        Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data
        usage during the connection to the Application, or other third-party
        charges. By using the Application, you accept responsibility for any
        such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the Application
        outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without
        disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
        which you are using the Application, they assume that you have obtained
        permission from the bill payer.
      </p>

      <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>

      <p>
        Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for
        your usage of the Application. For instance, it is your responsibility
        to ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of
        battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider
        cannot be held responsible.
      </p>

      <p>You are responsible for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintaining the confidentiality of your account information</li>
        <li>All activities conducted through your account</li>
        <li>
          Ensuring your use of the Application complies with applicable laws and
          regulations
        </li>
        <li>Any content you submit or share through the Application</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Service Availability and Updates</h2>

      <p>
        In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the
        Application, it is important to note that while they strive to ensure
        that it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on third
        parties to provide information to them so that they can make it
        available to you. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any
        loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of relying
        entirely on this functionality of the Application.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Service Provider may wish to update the Application at some point.
        The Application is currently available as per the requirements for the
        operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend
        the availability of the Application to) may change, and you will need to
        download the updates if you want to continue using the Application. The
        Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the
        Application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the
        particular operating system version installed on your device. However,
        you agree to always accept updates to the Application when offered to
        you.
      </p>

      <h2>Service Termination</h2>

      <p>
        The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the Application
        and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination
        notice to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination,
        (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b)
        you must cease using the application, and (if necessary) delete it from
        your device.
      </p>

      <p>Upon termination of your account or the Application:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your access to the Application will be immediately revoked</li>
        <li>
          Any data associated with your account may be deleted in accordance
          with the Privacy Policy
        </li>
        <li>
          You may request a copy of your data before termination by contacting
          the Service Provider
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Prohibited Activities</h2>
